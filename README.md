# TRON

## Description

Tron is a game that is playable in the browser based on the classic Tron game.

## Goals

* Build a game that is playable in the browser
* Use design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Separate business-logic code from view-related code
* Use test-driven design to build a client-side application

## Design Approach

* Our style was inspired by classic arcade games.
* We used a pixel/digital font that resembles a classic game.
* The color palette was based on the Tron Legacy movie.

## Technical Approach

* We used ES6, and webpack to bundle our files.
* We created different files that contain the game's object classes.
* Our game logic is in a separate file.

## Difficulties
